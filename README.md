# Student Registration Database
In this project, my goal is to establish a database to store information of student and course registration.

The student should provide the code of the course and the time or the section number.
The program should then determine whether that particular section has any space available.
If there is, then the necessary updates should be done to reflect that the student has been registered for that course. If not, a message should be displayed.

This program should allow students to register for a number of courses, one-by-one but to only once for the same student, course, year and semester. In addition, there is a limit to the number of courses a student can take in a semester.

Also there is another function that generates a class list for each section.
The information should include the course code, section code, course name, time, place, weekday(s), instructor and the list of 2 students in the alphabetical order of their last names with their ids, first names, major and year.
